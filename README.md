# A Dynamic Day Planner

## Description

For this assignment, we built a simple site that a user can plan their day with. We dynamically built blocks for each hour throughout the work day that a user can fill and save using local storage. To help the user keep track of their agenda, the blocks will change color as time passes. The current hour block is colored red, blocks that have already passed will turn grey and blocks in the future are colored green. 

---------------------------

The deployed and functional site can be found here: <https://spencerv86.github.io/dynamic-day-planner/>

The full process can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/spencerv86/dynamic-day-planner) repository linked here:
